                <h3>Cars</h3>
                <p>In my opinion a <mark>car</mark> enthusiast is someone who see's vehicles as a sort of living breathing thing.<br /> To me someone who can see that <mark>cars</mark> not only have a <em>heart and soul</em> but are very alive makes them a car enthusiast.<br /> If you see vehicles as more than just transportation but as an item with a soul that given it being the right <mark>car</mark> connects with you on a deeper level than just the driving portion.<br /> <strong>If you can see the heart of a <mark>car</mark> you're an enthusiast to me.</strong></p>
                <p>It all started when i was about 15-16 years old, some of my friends took me out to some late night touge runs</p>
                <p>Now that i'm older my hobby has went more and more for the track-direction with Time-Attack as the main interest</p>

            <h4>Touge</h4>
            <p>Illegal and now turned professional form of racing in Japan involving two cars chasing each other single file through a twisty course, traditionally mountain roads.<br /> If the chase car catches up by the end it wins, if the lead car pulls away it wins.<br /> Popularized in the US by the recent "JDM craze" and JDM option videos</p>

            <h4>Time Attack</h4>
            <p>A time attack is a type of motorsport where the race cars compete against a clock, and not directly against each other.<br /> Each car is timed through one circuit of the track, and there are no other cars on the track at that time.<br /> The car makes a preliminary circuit, then runs the timed lap, and then finishes with a cool-down lap.</p>

        <h2>My friends thoughts about my hobby</h2>
        <p>Most of my friends have the same hobby as me.<br /> People who dont have the same enthusiasm about cars might find it odd how one can spend so much money and time on a vehicle.</p>
